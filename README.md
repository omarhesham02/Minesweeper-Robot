# Minesweeper Robot
 An implementation of a robot that collects mines from a minesweeper board, implemented using Haskell as a project for the CSEN 403: Concepts of Programming Languages course at the German University in Cairo.
 Given the starting position of the robot on the board as a pair of (x, y) coordinates as well as a list of (x, y) coordinates of the positions of the mines, the program produces a list of actions (moving up, down, left, right, or collecting a mine) that the robot can take in order to visit and collect all mines.
 
 The project only required a program to solve a 4x4 board and necessitated an implementation in such a way that the solution was to be reached via brute force. This implementation, along with its technical report, are titled [minesweeper_robot](https://github.com/omarhesham02/Minesweeper-Robot/blob/main/minesweeper_robot.hs) and [Minesweeper Robot Report](https://github.com/omarhesham02/Minesweeper-Robot/blob/main/Minesweeper%20Robot%20Report.pdf) in this reporsitory respectively. 
 
 The project also included a bonus part which required optimizing the program so that it can solve a board of any size, not just 4x4, which we have also implemented. This bonus implementation along with its technical report can be found in this repository as the files entitled [minesweeper_robot_bonus](https://github.com/omarhesham02/Minesweeper-Robot/blob/main/minesweeper_robot_bonus.hs) and [Minesweeper Robot Report - Bonus Implementation](https://github.com/omarhesham02/Minesweeper-Robot/blob/main/Minesweeper%20Robot%20Report%20-%20Bonus%20Implementation.pdf) respectively.
 
 
 Please ignore the comical screenshots of game runs in both reports. They were a requirement for the project reports. I do apologize for any damage inflicted on your eyes as a result :).
